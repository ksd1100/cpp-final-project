# Dumb C++ Chatbot

A simple terminal-based chatbot written in C++.  
It reads user input, transforms it into lowercase, and replies to simple hardcoded or predetermined statements.
Any unrecognized inputs receive a default clueless response from the chatbot.

## Features & Creative Elements

- Case-insensitive

  The input is transformed to lowercase so users can avoid worrying about case sensitivity.
- Statement detection

  Recognizes certain input and responds accordingly.
- Fallback reply

  Any other input triggers a reply informing the user that the chatbot does not understand.

## Project Set Up in GitHub CodeSpaces

Follow these steps to compile and run the chatbot inside a Codespace:

1. Open your repository in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Open the integrated terminal.
3. Ensure youâ€™re in the directory containing `main.cpp`.
4. Compile the code with a C++ compiler and run the compiled executable.
